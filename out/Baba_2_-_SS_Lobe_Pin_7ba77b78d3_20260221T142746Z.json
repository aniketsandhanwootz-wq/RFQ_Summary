      "snippet": "# TX20 Pin Security Head Screw Specification Summary\n\nThis is a **custom security fastener** with a 6-lobe pin torx drive (TX20) designed for tamper-resistant applications requiring medium security resistance[2][5].\n\n## Key Specifications\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| **Drive Type** | TX20 Pin (6-lobe star with center pin) |\n| **Thread Size** | M8 × 1.25 pitch |\n| **Overall Length** | 12 mm |\n| **Head Height** | 4 mm |\n| **Threaded Length** | 8 mm |\n| **Material** | Stainless Steel A2 |\n| **Finish** | Plain/Natural (no additional coating) |\n\n## Functional Characteristics\n\n**Security Features:** The TX20 pin torx drive provides **medium-level anti-tamper security**, requiring a special pin torx bit for insertion and removal rather than standard torx tools[1]. This design reduces slippage and cam-out compared to Phillips or standard drives, minimizing damage to the drive tip and screw head[2].\n\n**Material Properties:** A2 stainless steel offers corrosion resistance suitable for general-purpose applications[2][5]. The plain finish indicates no additional protective plating (such as Delta Protekt® or zinc coating) is applied[1].\n\n**TX20 Drive Specifications:** According to torx specifications, the TX20 drive has a circumscribed circle diameter (ØA) of 3.94 mm and an incircle diameter (ØB) of 2.83 mm[7].\n\n**Application Suitability:** Pin TX security screws are **2-way reusable fasteners** suitable for applications requiring maintenance access while maintaining tamper resistance[5]. The custom dimensions (particularly the short 12 mm length and 4 mm head height) suggest specialized applications with space constraints."
