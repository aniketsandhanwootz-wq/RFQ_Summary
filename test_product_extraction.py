"""
test_product_extraction.py
──────────────────────────
Tests the product-extraction pipeline (prompt v3) without hitting Claude or Glide:

  1. NDJSON parses into typed products and separate query objects
  2. lenient parsing survives fences, pretty-printed objects and junk lines
  3. rows with no name never reach the product table
  4. the prompt rules that are checked in code produce warnings, not silence
  5. the Glide payload carries the right column ids, types and defaults
  6. query rows link to the Row IDs Glide returns for their products

Run:
    python test_product_extraction.py
